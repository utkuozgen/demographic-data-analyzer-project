# [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer)

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:

- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)

- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
- Use the starter code in the file demographic_data_analyzer.py. Update the code so all variables set to None are set to the appropriate calculation or code. Round all decimals to the nearest tenth.
